# Hangman Basics

## Game URL

https://octater.github.io/hangman-client/

## Technologies

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   JavaScript
-   Bootstrap
-   Ajax
-   Rails

## Planning

Created a basic wireframe for the hangman game.  Created user stories for
several user actions.

## Development Process

Using the wireframe, constructed the html and css that I could start with.
During the construction, both of these files were updated several times.

From the html, I started coding on functions starting on the top left of the
html.  I would work on the top left dropdown functions until they were somewhat
working as expected.  Then I started on the hangman columns and scoring engine.
In the html, I only got to 2 of the hangman columns.  The third column was
going to list the top players but ran out of time.

Lastly, I commented out the console logs and errors.

## Problem-solving strategy

Whenever I encountered a problem, I would first go back to my notes and the
presentations.  I used Google almost hourly looking up commands and researching
errors.  I would open issues after about 30 minutes of thrashing.

## Unsolved problems

None. (hopefully)

## User stories

- as a future player I would like to signup so I could play hangman at a later time.
- as a signed up player I would like to sign in to play a hangman game now.
- as a signed in player, I would like to change my password so I don't get hacked.
- as a signed in player, I would like to play the game so I am selecting play.
- as a great hangman player, I would like to see my playing record so I will select show stats.
- as a frustrated hangman player, I would like to have a drink with friends so I am selecting the log out
